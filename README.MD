### Ghost Block Mod (1.8.9)
> Forge 1.8.9 mod that adds ability to make client sided ghost blocks by right clicking a stonk (and adds a key to do the same thing!)

Had to take a deep dive down memory lane... Had to downgrade to IntelleJ 2019.3.5 with JDK 8 (gradle wouldn't work otherwise.)

**Check releases tab for pre-built jars**

#### If you prefer to build yourself:
1. `git clone https://github.com/ZECHEESELORD/ghostblock.git` or download source
2. `./gradlew build`
3. Output file is in `builds/libs`

*A star would be greatly appreciated.*
